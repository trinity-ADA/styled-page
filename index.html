        Journey so far has been challenging. I have been introduced to the
        different areas of software development, learnt the basic
        structure/skeleton of the HTML page, and the importance of CSS in
        <b>beautifying web pages</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I now know how to use Git and Github to
        <i>create, push, pull, clone and fork a repository</i>. Also, I was
        introduced to the heirarchy that exsist in CSS, the different selectors,
        their <i>specificity</i> and the concept of inheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was also taught how to apply the <b>box model</b> (content, padding,
        border, and margin) to a web page.

      <p>
        <b>PADDING:</b> The <i>inner space</i> between the content and the
        border.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>BORDER:</b> The <i>perimeter</i> of the box. Border can be made
        visible or invisible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>MARGIN:</b> The space between your border and the browswer's page.
        That is, the <i>space surrounding the box</i>.
